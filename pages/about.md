Hi, I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
Thanks for stumbling upon my little space on the web. I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast who's always eager to explore every aspect of cybersecurity. Whether it's exploring new technologies, discovering innovative solutions, or learning about the latest trends and developments, I'm always eager to dive in and expand my knowledge. With a caffeine boost, I love to play Capture the Flag (CTF) and dive into the world of Red Teaming and DevSecOps. 

I'm currently studying for a Diploma in CSE at Lovely Professional University in Punjab, India. When I'm not busy hacking away at code, I will be researching something new or that fascinates me. Overall, I'm deeply committed to the field of cybersecurity and am always looking for new opportunities to learn, grow, and make a difference. Whether I'm exploring new domains of cybersecurity or connecting with fellow tech enthusiasts, I'm always excited to be part of a vibrant community. So, if you ever need someone to geek out with about cybersecurity, I'm your person!

Connect with me on social media for tech and cyber conversations. Let's explore the fascinating world of tech together!
